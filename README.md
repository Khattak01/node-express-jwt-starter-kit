Abstract 

The spread of the dengue virus in Pakistan has reached catastrophic levels and has claimed the lives of millions and continues to do so. Over 44,000 cases and 66 deaths all over the country have been reported as of 2019. There has still been no appropriate vaccine introduced to treat the Dengue virus. The only way to overcome it is to detect it in patients during the initial stages. The purpose of this project is to develop a system that will predict the possibility of dengue in suspected patients. The system will detect dengue fever in patients based on the patient’s early symptoms, clinical data available, and socio-demographic data provided so that precautionary measures can be taken before it leads to anything severe. We’ll be using machine learning algorithms to develop a system that will take the patients’ data as input and be able to make predictions based on that data about their chances of carrying the virus and being affected by it. It will also tell the severity of the disease in patients. We will integrate our prediction tool with our web application and mobile native app where users such as patients, lab management etc. will register and use the tools. Moreover, the government authorities and labs often do not have enough data available to determine the severity of dengue in certain areas of Pakistan. Our system will help to improve the coordination between the government and labs by sharing the data provided by the registered labs.


Introduction 

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito that is infected by the virus. The virus cannot spread directly from one person to another. It spreads through a mosquito when it becomes infected by biting a person with dengue virus in their blood. Each year, an estimated 400 million dengue infections occur around the world. Out of these 400, around 500,000 cases develop into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which results in up to 25,000 deaths annually all over the globe.  

Sometimes, its symptoms are often mild and can be confused with those of the flu or common tropical infections like enteric fever, leptospirosis, typhus fever, malaria, etc. This makes it all the more difficult for doctors to detect and treat dengue in patients. This could lead to misdiagnosis due to which the patient might not receive appropriate care and attention. This puts them at greater risk of developing dengue fever or a more severe form of the disease and could even lead to death. People with weak immune systems as well as those who have been infected with dengue for the second time are at greater risk of developing a severe form of dengue.  

Our designed system will use machine learning algorithms and predict whether the respective patient is carrying dengue virus or not and will provide initial measures to cure the disease if the patient got affected. It will generate a detailed report for the user which they can also print. 

Our system will include a chat-bot that will help the users using the system. The users can convey their queries in the form of text or voice. Depending upon the severity of the patients’ disease, the system will also recommend various labs based on their ratings. If our system detects multiple cases from a particular location, it will send an alert message to all the registered users, hospitals, labs, governmental organizations, etc. The users will have a dashboard where they can easily manage their profiles.  

We will maintain a central database of all the users and the patients which can be accessed by the government and will help them to control and overcome the next possible outbreak of the virus. 

The labs can also register with our system. We will recommend nearby labs to our users based on their location and the reviews and feedback provided by the users. 

Problem Statement 

As the dengue virus is an infectious disease and has similar symptoms like other diseases so it could be misdiagnosed and put the life of the patients in danger. 

Each year in Pakistan, the dengue virus claims the lives of thousands. Its impact on Pakistan has been calamitous.  

There has been no vaccine introduced for this virus so far and lack of awareness has resulted in the disease’s widespread impact. 

Due to the lack of a system that could detect dengue, it is especially hard to diagnose it in patients during the initial stages which could lead to severe cases and even deaths. Therefore, without a proper system in order, the treatment of dengue can be very expensive for people living in backward areas. 

The labs and the government authorities in Pakistan have never been able to overcome outbreaks or pandemics such as dengue due to the lack of coordination and sufficient data. For instance, the coronavirus pandemic has been very hard to overcome as the government in Pakistan has not been able to detect cases. 

Proposed Solution 

Initially, the collected data will consist of input features like patients’ symptoms, clinical features, and socio-demographic attributes to develop a machine learning model. The feature engineering technique is applied to the collected data to normalize it. Deep learning algorithms will be applied to the dataset to train several models. The model with higher accuracy among others is selected and is capable of making quality predictions. 

Advantages/Benefits of Proposed System 

The advantages and benefits of our system are listed below: 

The system will be time saving for patients who are unable to visit hospitals for regular sessions. 

The system will prove beneficial for people who cannot afford frequent visits to clinics. People will be able to get recommendations without having to spend time and extra money. 

The system will store patients’ records and medical information which can be accessed by the government’s health sector to take precautions for any future outbreaks based on the data. 

Unlike general medical consultation systems, this system will only concentrate on predicting dengue and suggesting initial precautions to be taken. This specificity of functionality will reduce the complexity of navigating through the system. 

The chat-bot will help the users and solve any possible queries without having to wait for the admin to respond. 

Project Scope 

Our system deals with the prediction of dengue virus based on the patients’ symptoms, clinical data gathered, and socio-demographic factors, etc. The system also predicts the severity of dengue in patients and provides precautionary measures to overcome the spread and impact of dengue fever. Although the system will provide guidance in case someone gets infected by disease but will not prescribe any medical treatment. The system will also suggest a suitable clinic or hospital for their treatment based on the patient’s location and the hospitals’ ratings. The system will send an alert message to respected authorities based on the location if it finds more than ten cases in a specific area. It will also recommend nearby labs based on our users’ location and ease of access along with their cost.
